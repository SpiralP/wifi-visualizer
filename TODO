drop capabilities after sniffing start?


change websocket interface to be {
  addr,
  state: "ap" | "station"
}

add a list of access points

show % packet loss from sequence numbers
  have 2 parts:
    sequence number difference
    per beacon interval vs sequence number
      this would only update if we capture more packets
      so we can assume a beacon every interval



sorting by other columns in table


convert CaptureIterator to use async methods instead of a blocking Iterator
  This will need pcap to be written with newer async/futures
